### Description

### App Evaluation

- **Story:** We care about the earth, and we hope that this app inspires people to be more aware and concious about their daily carbon footprint. We want this app to be as simple and user friendly as possible, so even the laziest people can use it easily. 
- **Market:** For everyone that cares about the future of Mother Nature
